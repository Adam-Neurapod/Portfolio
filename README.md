🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m a junior Python developer with a strong interest in AI. I learn systematically and build my own projects that connect programming, artificial intelligence, and digital avatars.
My goal is to move from learning into practice — into a company where I can grow, contribute my ideas, and bring creativity into technology.
I’m quick to learn new concepts, motivated to improve, and enjoy combining logical problem-solving with creative thinking.

🛠️ Skills

Programming – Python 🐍

Conditions (if, elif, else), loops (for, while)

Working with libraries (random, json, re)

Regular expressions (regex) for text processing

Functions and basic OOP concepts

File handling (open, read/write)


Git & GitHub 💻

Repository initialization, committing, branching

Push/pull to remote repositories

Working with README and documentation


AI & Neural Networks 🧠

Practical work with GPT models (ChatGPT API)

Basics of TensorFlow/Keras: creating & training simple models

First experiments with NLP (text data, chatbots)


AI – Theoretical Knowledge 📚
Besides practice, I study theory to understand AI principles:

Perceptron & logic gates (AND, OR, XOR): basics of weights, bias, and activation functions

Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP): layers, backpropagation, learning

Activation functions: sigmoid, ReLU, tanh

Architectures I understand:

MLP: classification, predictions

CNN: image processing

RNN, LSTM/GRU: sequential data, text, time series

Transformers: modern language models (GPT, BERT)

GANs & Autoencoders: content generation, denoising, data reduction



Applications & UI 📱

Kivy – building simple mobile apps (Calma project)

Basics of GUI and event-driven programming


Digital Creation 🎨

Blender – 3D modeling and avatar design

Unreal Engine (MetaHuman) – experimenting with realistic digital characters

2D concepts & simple animations

🚀 Projects

🔮 CyberQuest – Text adventure in a cyberpunk style. Uses regex for player input and JSON map system. → Training logic, regex, and code structure.
CyberQuest v1.0
- https://github.com/Adam-Neurapod/Portfolio/blob/main/CYBERQUEST%20v1.0%20Final.py

🏙️ Stonemill – Fictional city chatbot. → Started with if/elif, later regex for more flexible responses.
Stonemill Bot
-https://github.com/Adam-Neurapod/Portfolio/blob/main/Stonemmil%20bot%20%20program.py

🌱 Calma – Mobile app built with Kivy. Offline mental-wellbeing guide. → Working with layouts, events, and UI.

👤 Digital Avatars – Experiments in Blender (sci-fi and realistic versions), linked with AI backend. → Combining technology + design.

🔑 Login System – Simple Python login, later extended with attack simulations (brute force, keylogger, phishing). → Bridging programming with cybersecurity practice.
