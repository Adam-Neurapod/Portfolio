🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m a junior Python developer with a strong focus on AI. I learn systematically and build my own projects that combine programming with real-world applications of artificial intelligence — from chatbots to neural networks. My goal is to join a team where I can grow, contribute my ideas, and help shape meaningful AI-driven tools. I’m motivated, curious, and enjoy solving problems by combining logic with creativity.

🧰 Core Programming Skills

Python – Conditions (if, elif, else), loops (for, while), functions, basic OOP concepts

Libraries – random, json, re, math, os

Regex – Advanced use of regular expressions for input processing and logic (used in multiple chatbot and game projects)

File Handling – Reading/writing files, working with .json and .csv formats

Git & GitHub – Version control, branching, commits, README/documentation, managing repositories


🧠 AI & Neural Networks

Chatbots & GPT API

Working with OpenAI models (ChatGPT API) and integrating them into projects

Created NeuraBuddy: a chatbot using structured QnA logic with follow-ups and smart branching

Prompt engineering and building hybrid logic-AI bots


CNN – Convolutional Neural Networks

Project AuraFace: design of CNN for facial image classification

Created training pipeline, processed labeled data, implemented basic CNN architecture

Experience with layers, filters, activation functions, softmax output


MLP & Perceptron Logic

Training simple networks on logic gates (AND, OR, XOR)

Understanding weights, bias, backpropagation and learning rate


Theoretical Understanding

Architectures: MLP, CNN, RNN, LSTM/GRU, Transformers, GANs, Autoencoders

Activation functions: sigmoid, tanh, ReLU

Use cases: classification, text generation, image recognition, anomaly detection



🚀 Projects

🔮 CyberQuest – Text-based cyberpunk adventure. Regex-powered player input and flexible game logic over JSON map system. 👉 CyberQuest v1.0

🏙️ Stonemill Bot – Fictional city chatbot. Started with if/elif, later refactored with regex. 👉 Stonemill Bot

🤖 NeuraBuddy – Smart QnA chatbot with JSON knowledge base and follow-up branching. Backend in Python, frontend in JS. Designed for future integration with AI-generated answers.

🧠 AuraFace – CNN-powered avatar system prototype. Designed for facial image training and recognition. Currently in development stage, used for learning CNN logic and model structuring.

🔐 Login System – Secure login system with features simulating attack vectors (brute force, phishing, keylogger). Used for practice in cybersecurity and Python file operations. 👉 Login System
